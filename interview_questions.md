## Ice Breaker

*Tell us a bit about what you've been working on recently.*

## HTML

Some people write good html, some people write bad html. What do you consider to be good HTML?

*Semantic, and well structured and validated HTML5. Using sections and articles appropriately. Following the right hierarchy for headings and using semantic elements such as the button tag rather than constructing a button out of a `<div>`.*

## CSS

When working on big websites CSS can quickly become unwieldy and unmaintainable. Tell me your approach to tackling this problem.

*A good CSS architecture should use an established naming convention such as BEM (block, element, modifier). It should follow a structure like OOCSS, or SMACSS for organising base elements, components and layouts. There should be a mention of global configuration such as a `_settings.scss` or `_config.scss` file. The candidate should preference a maintainable and scaleable codebase over writing "clean css" and avoiding class names.*

## JavaScript

Can you give me some examples of how you have used javascript on a recent project?

Did you use a framework? If so, why did you choose that framework?

How do you organise your code (*ES6 modules, AMD, other*)?

What did you use to make sure your JS didn't break? (*Mocha, Karma, Chai*)

## Responsive Web Design

What do you understand by the term responsive web design?

Can you tell me about a responsive project you have worked on recently?

## Performance

What performance issues do you have to be aware of when building a website for mobile devices?

(*Asset weight, the number of initial HTTP requests, setting and living up to a performance budget*)

## Accessibility

We like to build all of our products so they comply as closely as possible to WCAG AA standards. Can you tell me a little about your experience with web accessibility and how you approach making a website accessible?

If you were going to check a website for accessibility what are some of the things you would look for?

What do you understand by the term progressive enhancement?

## High Quality Code

How do you make sure that the code that you write is of a high quality and continues to work as expected?

*ESLint, JShint, CSSLint, HTML validator*

*Mention JS testing frameworks as above, Mocha, Karma, Chai*

## Version Control

What's your preferred method of version control (Git, SVN)?

What's your version control workflow when developing features for a product?

## Agile

Do you have experience working in an Agile team? What "flavour" of Agile did you use (Kanban, XP, Scrum, etc.)

How did the Agile process helped you deliver a product?

## Keeping Up-to-date

How do you keep up to date with the latest front end technologies, techniques and best practices?

## HR Questions

What sort of project are you looking for?

When could you start?
